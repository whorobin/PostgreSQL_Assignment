#1. What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is a free tool that helps you store, manage, and organize data in tables. It's like a smart spreadsheet that can handle large amounts of data and complex searches.

#2. Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.
( i ) A Primary Key uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot be null.
( ii ) A Foreign Key links one table to another, ensuring data consistency between related tables.

#03. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?
( i ) VARCHAR stores variable-length text and uses only the needed space.
( ii ) CHAR stores fixed-length text and pads with spaces if the input is shorter.

# 04. What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?
The JOIN operation combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns. It helps retrieve connected data from multiple tables in a single query.

# 05. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.
The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns. It is used with aggregation functions (like COUNT, SUM) to summarize data for each group.

#06. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() in PostgreSQL?
( i ) The COUNT() function in PostgreSQL is used to count the number of rows in a table or the number of non-null values in a column.
( ii ) The SUM() function in PostgreSQL adds up all the values in a numeric column.
( iii ) The AVG() function adds up all the values in a numeric column and divides by the count of those values to get the average.
